Marvel Information Portal is a web application for browsing information about Marvel characters and comics using the Marvel API.

The project was created as an educational pet project to demonstrate frontend development skills, API integration, and interaction with a custom backend.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to explore Marvel characters and comics through a clean and responsive interface.  
The frontend is built with React, while authentication logic is handled via a custom backend server connected to a PostgreSQL database.

⚠️ **Important note:**  
This repository uses a custom backend server created by me.  
The backend is not publicly available, but the registration and authentication logic can be easily replaced or adapted to your own server.
